# Introduction to haldls, lola and stadls

This repository focuses on system configuration and control.
It contains multiple APIs for different aspects:
* {ref}`haldls` provides a data representation for configurable hardware entities,
* {ref}`lola` builds on haldls to provide a homogenized view on configurable hardware entities,
* {ref}`stadls` provides an abstraction for experiment runtime control.
